# Concentrate!

 **This app is a simple iOS game designed to test your memory and concentration**
 
## How Can I play? 

**When the game starts you are given a screen with 12 face down cards, as seen below:**

**Tapping on a card will flip it over and increase your score by one**

**If the next card you tap is identical to your card, both cards get removed from the game**

**If both cards are different, they get flipped back over and you have to try to remember their location**

**The goal is to finish with the lowest score possible. Once all matching cards are found the game ends**
